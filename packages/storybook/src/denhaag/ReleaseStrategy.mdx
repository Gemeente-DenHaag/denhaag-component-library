### Production

Used in production in a variety of situations, well tested, stable APIs, mostly patches and minor releases. Changes are communicated via the version number and via the changelog.

### Beta

Used in production in a specific situation, evolving APIs based on feedback, breaking changes are still likely. Design tokens are unlikely to change.

### Alpha

Used in prototypes and in projects that are still in development, breaking changes occur frequently and are not communicated. Design tokens exist but are subject to change.

### Work in Progress

Don't use in production. Breaking changes occur frequently. The component cannot be used as CSS only component. Design tokens not implemented or experimental.
