# Den Haag Design System

## Component Library

Find our React component library on GitHub:

[nl-design-system/denhaag](https://github.com/nl-design-system/denhaag)

## Design Tokens

Design tokens are all the values needed to construct and maintain a design system — spacing, color, typography, object styles, animation, etc. — represented as data. These can represent anything defined by design: a color as a RGB value, an opacity as a number, an animation ease as Bezier coordinates. They’re used in place of hard-coded values in order to ensure flexibility and unity across all product experiences.

Design tokens are directly integrated into our component libraries and UI kits. They cover the various options of platform scales, color themes, component states, and more.

The design tokens are [available as CSS variables on GitHub](https://github.com/nl-design-system/denhaag/tree/master/src/styles) and in the [Figma Design Kit for the Den Haag Design System](https://www.figma.com/file/JpoY3waVoQGlLQzQXTL9nn/).

## Getting started

This getting started section explains how to use the React Components in your project.

### Add required dependencies

Add the NPM package for the components. The component library can be imported as a whole, or per component.

In order to add the entire component library, install [@gemeente-denhaag/denhaag-component-library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gemeente-denhaag/denhaag-component-library) using your favorite package manager.

For example, ```npm install @gemeente-denhaag/denhaag-component-library```.

Alternatively, you can install specific components: ```npm install @gemeente-denhaag/button```.

After installing the dependency, you can start using the Den Haag components as follows:
```jsx
import {Button, StylesProvider} from "@gemeente-denhaag/denhaag-component-library";
// Import your design tokens here as well! Otherwise your components will be unstyled :(

function App() {
    return (
        <StylesProvider>
            <Button variant={"primary-action"}>Click here!</Button>
        </StylesProvider>
    );
}

export default App;
```
**Important:** Your app, or the section which uses Den Haag components, will need to be wrapped in the `StylesProvider` component. This ensures that styles are loaded correctly.

#### Applying your theme

By default, all components in the library are unstyled.
If you wish to apply your organisation's theme to the components, define the design tokens for the components you need, and import them in your app.

For Den Haag applications, import the [@gemeente-denhaag/design-tokens-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gemeente-denhaag/design-tokens-components) package, and import the css in your application.
