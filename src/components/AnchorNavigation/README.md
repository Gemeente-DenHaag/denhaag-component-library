## Content guidelines

### Labels

Labels should:

- Contain one to three words.
- Have the same name as the sub-heading on the page
- Be clear and predictable. Users need to know what to find under each sub-heading.
- Make sure the sub-headings are recognizable as key elements of the page.
- Make sure the words you use in the anchor links are exactly the same as the words in the sub-headings they refer to.
- Avoid unnecessary words and articles such as “the”, “a” or “an”.

## Best practices

### Dos

Anchor navigations should:

- Allow the user to return to a previous step to review the process
- Create a clear path to completion
- Be clear as possible in order not to confuse users
- Bring the user to the specific topic he is clicking on
- Show the subheadings preceding the current subheading as active
- Continue on the next line for very long labels
- Be sticky
- Hide the menu overlay on mobile if a user clicked on a subject
- Show that the lines fill up as soon as a user scrolls

### Don’ts

Anchor navigations should:

- Not have more than 3 lines on desktop
- Not only the current subheading as active where you are, but also all previous subheadings
