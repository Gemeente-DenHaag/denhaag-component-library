## When to use

Use the procedure when a user needs to be informed of the steps ahead. This can be a combination of digital and
non-digital steps. For example to explain the procedure of getting a new passport. Being clear about what people can
expect will have a calming effect and reduces calls to a callcenter.

## When not to use

When there are multiple ways, when it is not a linear process.

## Best practices

### Dos

- create a clear path to completion.
- be shown from top to bottom.
- be clear as possible in order not to confuse users.

## Content guidelines

Explanation text should:

- provide additional information about the step if it needs more information.
- be clear and short.
- be present only if the information is important and the user needs to read it to understand what is going to happen in
  that step.

## Content guidelines

Color contrast should be sufficient.
