# Blockquote

A blockquote shows a highlight or quote in a page that should stand out.

## When to use

Use a blockquote when there is a quote in the text you want to highlight, to tease the next alinea or highlight an important line. Mostly used in an journalistic way, to decorate the page.

## Alternatives and related components

- Use a note component when it’s important to highlight a warning or information.

## Anatomy

The blockquote consists of:

1. Marker: to create an indent in te page
2. Text: to display the quote

## Accessibility

Do not use this component to indent text. Screen readers use the <blockquote> element to:
Provide semantic understanding of page content by announcing blockquote as quote
Define a sectioning root in HTML5, which means that any <h1> - <h6> element doesn't become part of the document’s outline
To make the blockquote content accessible, use the <cite> attribute with a valid URL
