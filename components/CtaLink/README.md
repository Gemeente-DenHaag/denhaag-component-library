# Call To Action Icon

A CTA icon is a standalone link that links to another page within the website or an external website related to the current page or to a video.

## When to use

CTA icons are used as navigational elements and are used on their own. They provide a middleweight option for navigation and stand out more than the normal links so use it sparingly. Like other interactive elements, too many CTA icons will clutter a page and make it difficult for users to identify their next steps.

Use CTA icons when you want users to:

- Navigate to a page or entirely different site that can also be viewed (see also - variant);
- Navigate to a website where a video is shown (such as YouTube);

## Alternatives and related components

- Use links for navigation actions that appear within or immediately after a sentence.
- Use calendar events when you link to an event.
- Use a download when there is a file being downloaded.
- Use a CTA image when there is a link in conjunction with an image.

## Anatomy

- Support icon: informs users at a glance about the type of the CTA;
- Text: additional information about the link;
- Link: shows the name of the page where it is being linked to;
- Container

## Content guidelines

### Text

_See also variant_

- Briefly provide context to the surrounding text as needed.
- Be able for users to anticipate what will happen when they click on the CTA icon.
- Always start with ‘Zie ook:’.

- Be scannable avoiding unnecessary words.
- Briefly provide context to the surrounding text as needed.
- Always start with ‘Bekijk’.

### Link

The link should:

- Must show a short and clear page name being linked to.

#### Video variant

The link should:

- Provide enough context use the {verb}+{noun} format unless the action is clear with a single verb.

## Best practices

### Do's

CTA icons should:

- Link to a page related to the current page;
- Link to a video;
- Be placed under or between a text (usually in a list);
- Be placed below each other if there are several CTA icons;

### Don'ts

CTA icons should:

- Not be used as a standalone link like ‘Learn more’ or ‘Forgot password?’;
- Not contain more than 3 CTA icons in a row;

### Logic

- Always show the first and current page
- Only use the collapsed icon if there are more than 4 pages.
- If the collapsed icon is used, always show on the right side the underlying page and next to this the current page.
  - If there are for example 5 pages, then show the homepage (1), hide the 2nd and 3rd page and show the 4th and current page (5).
  - If there are for example 6 pages, then show the homepage
