## Best practices

### Do's

Downloads should:

- Describe what the file is;
- Include file type and size. Showing the file size is particularly nice for users that are on reduced data allowences (i.e. mobile), and also offers an indication on how long a file might take to download;
- Show the size in kB’s when it’s <1000 kB and in MB’s when it’s >999 kB;
- Show 1 decimal after the decimal point of the size;
- Download the file on the used device;
- Be grouped under each other when there is more than 1 download;
- Be placed under or between a text (usually in a list);
- Be full width (100%);

### Don'ts

Download should:

- Not be described as a file;
- Not open the file in another tab;
