# Conditions

Use the conditions block on product pages and when a set of conditions must be set before you can request or do
something.

## When to use

Do not use the conditions block for any other purpose such as displaying bulleted lists.

## Alternatives and related components

Use cards if more than three lines of text need to be shown in list tiles.

## Anatomy

- top icon with border
- title
- bullet list with checkmarks left and text next to it

### Dos

Conditions should:

- Keep the terms and conditions as short and concise as possible.
- The title should always be called ‘Voorwaarden’.
- Don't try to put an elaborate explanation about a condition in the condition block. Rather do this after the block.
