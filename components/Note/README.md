## Introduction

The note shows a message that is important and should stand out for users to notice.

## Content guidelines

- Notes should describe briefly and succinctly what matters.
- Limit the text to one or two short sentences.

## Best practices

### Do's

Notes should:

- Explain in as few sentences as possible what it is about.
- Appear in the body of a page.
- Used carefully and sparingly for only important information.
- Use the default icons for info and warning statuses.

### Don'ts

Notes should:

- Not be shown in forms if, for example, there is an error.
- Not show the same information that is already in the body text.
- Not be used more than 2x on a page because otherwise it will get too much emphasis and the rest of the text will get less attention
- Not rely on colour alone to convey meaning or tone.
- Not be used for subsequent action. No button may be placed below it.

## Usage

- Info: Provide additional information to users.
- Warning: Warn users about important information.
