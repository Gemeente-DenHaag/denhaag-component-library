# ReadSpeaker

## Content guidelines

The ReadSpeaker is made to make content more accessible. Use the out-of-the-box functionality from the ReadSpeaker.

## Best practices

### Dos

The ReadSpeaker should:

- Be visible on every content page.
- Always be shown beneath the title of the page so that the user can immediately associate the button with the action of listening to the page.
- Have only one ReadSpeaker button on a page.
- Ensure that the page automatically scrolls along with the text being read.
- Be usable as standard functionality works.

### Don’ts

The ReadSpeaker should:

- Not have more than one ReadSpeaker button on a page.
