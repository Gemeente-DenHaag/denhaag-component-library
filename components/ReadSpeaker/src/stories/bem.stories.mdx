        Once upon a time, in a lush green meadow, there lived a little lamb named Snowy. Snowy was the youngest of the
        flock and was loved by all the other sheep. Her wool was soft and fluffy, and her eyes were bright and curious.
        Snowy loved to frolic in the meadow, playfully leaping over tall blades of grass, and chasing after butterflies.
      </p>
      <p className="utrecht-paragraph">
        One sunny day, as Snowy was grazing with the rest of the flock, she wandered off into the nearby woods. The
        other sheep called out to her, warning her not to go too far, but Snowy was too curious to listen. She pranced
        through the woods, admiring the trees and the wildflowers, until she realized she was lost. The forest had grown
        dark, and the trees looked menacing. Snowy began to cry, her bleats echoing through the woods. But just as she
        had given up hope, a kind farmer stumbled upon her and took her back to her flock. From that day on, Snowy never
        wandered off too far from her beloved flock, content to live out her days in the safety of the meadow.
