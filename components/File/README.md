## Accessibility

In order to comply with accessibility standards you should not force a file to open in a new tab. It must be left up to the user to decide whether to download a file, or open in a new tab.

The one exception to this rule is in forms as there are often challenges around caching user data. When ns-download is used within ns-form; if the browser can display the file type it will open in a new tab.

## Content guidelines

None.

## Best practices

### Dos

Files download should:

- Be used for all downloads.
- Include file size and type. Showing the file size is particularly nice for users that are on reduced data allowences (i.e. mobile), and also offers an indication on how long a file might take to download.

### Donâ€™ts

Files download should:

- Not be described as a file.
