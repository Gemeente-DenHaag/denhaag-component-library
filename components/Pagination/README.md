## Best practices

### Dos

Paginations should:

- Only be used for lists with more than 25 items
- Clearly identify which page the user is on by displaying the current page number
- Be placed at the bottom of a long list that has been split up into pages
- Navigate to the previous and next set of items in the paged list
- Hint when users are at the first or the last page by disabling the corresponding button
- Always show the first and last page
- Replace infinite scrolling on very long pages

### Donâ€™ts

Paginations should:

- Not show more than 5 pages next to each other. Instead, use the dots and show on the right the last page

### Logic

Only use dots if there are more than 5 pages.

- If there are many pages and the user is on one of the first three pages, show these pages followed by the dots and then show the last page.
- If there are many pages and the user is on one of the last three pages, show the first page followed by the dots and then show the last 4 pages.
- If there are many pages, always show the active page in the middle and show the first and last page next to the dots.
