## Use of images

### Header image

The header image appears above the content. It will always take space on 1 column.

### Standard images

Standard images appear after the text or below it. There can be multiple images below each other. It will always take space on 1 column.

### Left or right aligned image

Standard, news and event templates allow images that are aligned left or right in the page. They will always take space on 1 of the two columns.

### Image gallery

The gallery is a bundle of images, where there are at least 2 images next to or below each other. The images are always left aligned in a gallery. They will always take space on 1, 2 or 3 columns.

## Accessibility

Images must always be supported with text alternatives which are descriptive of the information they present. Alternative text is read out by screen readers for users with visual impairments and where an image does not load. Text should never be included as part of the image as this will not be read out by screen readers or translated by automated translators.

W3C gives guidance on how to make images accessible.

## Content guidelines

None.

## Best practices

### Do's

Images should:

- Illustrate concrete things (for example, animals, I.D. cards, plate stickers), not abstract concepts (for example, light, holistic, synergy)
- Be optimized for the web to reduce the file size as much as possible while maintaining a reasonable quality

### Don'ts

Images should:

- Not be unrelated to the pageâ€™s subject matter
- Not be too small to show important details, especially if viewed on mobile devices
- Not have text on it
