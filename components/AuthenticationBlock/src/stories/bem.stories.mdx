# Authentication Block

This is a early implementation of the Authentication Card.
In practice we discovered a better name and more responsive way to implement this component. Please use this new implementation: `denhaag-card-authentication` instead.

## Deprecated

In the future we will remove this old implementation, so if you are using this component please consider updating your code.
Otherwise you will not be able to keep receiving CSS updates without breaking changes.
