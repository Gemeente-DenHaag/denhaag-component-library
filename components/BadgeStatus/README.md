# Badge (status)

Status badges are used to inform users about the status of an object, about an action that has been taken or to label, categorize, or organize items using keywords that describe them.

## When to use

Use status badges when content is mapped to multiple categories, and the user needs a way to differentiate between them. In this case it can be used in data tables, for example. Furthermore, it can be used when there are different statuses being communicated, such as in a timeline.

## Accessibility

Status badges that convey information with color include text provided by the visually hidden component. This text is read by assistive technologies such as screen readers, so that users with vision problems can access the meaning of the badges in the context.

## Content guidelines

### Label

Labels should:

- Using a single word to describe the status of an object.
- Use only two words when you need to describe a complex condition. For example "Not Available" and "Partially Satisfied".
- Describe the state in which verbs occur, always in the past tense. For example "Declined" and "Completed".

## Best practices

### Dos

Status badges must:

- Utilize recognizable color patterns so users can quickly identify their status or level of importance
- Be clearly labeled with short, scannable text
- Be positioned to clearly identify the object they are informing or tagging

### Donâ€™ts

Status badges should:

- Not be used for numerical counts. Use a badge instead.
