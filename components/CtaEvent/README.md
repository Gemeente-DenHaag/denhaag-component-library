## Content guidelines

### Date icon

The date icon should:

- Contain the digit of the event day. If the digit is <10, then use ‘0’ before for the number (e.g. ‘01’, ‘05’);
- Contain only the first three letters of the month.

### Heading link

The heading link should:

- Show in one sentence what the event is all about;
- Start the sentence with the event type (e.g. ‘Spreekuur’ or ‘Bijeenkomst’);
- Use the hyphen to break the text.

### Date

The date should:

- Show the full date, so the day (e.g. ‘Maandag’), digit of the day (e.g. ‘1’), month (e.g. ‘Januari’) and year (e.g. ‘2022’);
- Not use the hyphen when breaking the text. Let the text continue on the next line.

## Best practices

### Do's

Calendar events should:

- Always link to a content event page;
- Be grouped under each other when there is more than 1 event;
- Be placed above, under or between a text (usually in a list);
- Be full width (100%)

### Don'ts

Calendar events should:

- Not be used to link to another page other than a content evenement page.
